# OpenHeimer
OpenHeimer is the (unofficial) open source version of the Copenheimer Discord bot. It scans tons of IP addresses in order to find public Minecraft servers exposed to the internet. The original version is currently closed-source and not available to anyone else, that's why this version exists.

:warning: OpenHeimer is under heavy development

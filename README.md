# OpenHeimer
OpenHeimer is the (unofficial) open source version of the Copenheimer project. It scans the entire internet in order to find public Minecraft servers. The original version is currently closed-source and not available to anyone else, that's why this version exists.

:warning: OpenHeimer is under heavy development. The current version of OpenHeimer (v0.1.0) is not stable and might crash (or break) anytime. Feel free to submit an issue or a pull reuqest!

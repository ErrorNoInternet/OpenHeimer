# OpenHeimer
OpenHeimer is the (unofficial) open source version of the Copenheimer project. It scans tons of IP addresses in order to find public Minecraft servers exposed to the internet. The original version is currently closed-source and not available to anyone else, that's why this version exists.

:warning: OpenHeimer is under heavy development. This current version of OpenHeimer is not fully working and might crash/break anytime. Use with caution.
